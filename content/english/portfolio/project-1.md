Prodoscore is a company based in Irvine, California that specializes in offering a proprietary scoring system that uses existing data collected on cloud technologies to measure and managing employee productivity. Prodoscore’s proprietary scoring system calculates an employee productivity score based on operationalized concepts of what makes an employee productive.


#### Executive Report

With 60% of the workforce categorized as knowledge workers, the need to manage employee productivity is necessary. This report looks to explore Prodoscore’s Productivity indicator, to uncover insights from activities that lay the foundation for value creation via productive outputs and determine if the metric is a valid and reliable indicator of knowledge worker productivity. Knowledge workers tend to hold white collar positions which don't have the same measurements employees in warehouses or physical labor heavy roles have when it comes to measuring productivity. This report will explore
the productive activities that lead to the successful execution of objectives.
