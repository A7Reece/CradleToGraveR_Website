Prodoscore is a company based in Irvine, California that specializes in offering a proprietary scoring system that uses existing data collected on cloud technologies to measure and managing employee productivity. Prodoscore’s proprietary scoring system calculates an employee productivity score based on operationalized concepts of what makes an employee productive.


#### Executive Report

With 60% of the workforce categorized as knowledge workers, the need to manage employee productivity is necessary. This report looks to explore Prodoscore’s Productivity indicator, to uncover insights from activities that lay the foundation for value creation via productive outputs and determine if the metric is a valid and reliable indicator of knowledge worker productivity. Knowledge workers tend to hold white collar positions which don't have the same measurements employees in warehouses or physical labor heavy roles have when it comes to measuring productivity. This report will explore
the productive activities that lead to the successful execution of objectives.

#### Primary Purpose

The primary purpose of this report is to:
1. Provide an independent study of Prodoscore’s Productivity Indicator
2. Establish Prodoscore as a valid indicator of knowledge worker productivity
3. Explore insights from the various components captured within an employee’s Prodoscore

#### Secondary Purpose

The secondary purpose of this report is to:
1. Learn how employees vary by productivity across multiple organizations and gain high level insights into employee productivity
2. Model observable employee behavioral patterns to learn ways to use data to effectively manage a workforce
3. Generate generalizable data-driven insights that provide actionable insights and approaches towards enhancing talent management
Findings
1. Prodoscore is a valid indicator of knowledge worker productivity as it reliably measures worker activities deemed productive over time. The multivariate model employed by Prododcore offers meaningful information surrounding the behavioral proclivities of employees as they interact with technology.
2. Three discrete employee productivity groups (high, average, and low productivity) emerged from the data offering group-based insights on employee productivity across knowledge workers.
3. Prodoscore can provide several applicable use cases ranging from calculating ROI, forecasting future productivity, and data-driven workforce segmentation planning.
